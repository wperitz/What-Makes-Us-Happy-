# What-Makes-Us-Happy-

This project was completed as coursework for STAT 3280: Data Visualization and Management at the University of Virginia. Spring, 2023.  

We all strive to be happy, yet what drives our pursuit can vary widely from one person to another, and one community to the next. The goal of this project is to explore the factors influencing happiness at multiple levels: myself as an individual, my home state of Virginia, and the United States as a whole. By investigating these different perspectives, I can discover how I fit into my community, while also shedding light on broader patterns of happiness.  

Through this project, I dive into two key dimensions that contribute to happiness:  

**How We Treat Our Bodies:** Physical activity and sleep patterns.  
**How We Spend Our Time:** Screen time, social media usage, and daily commutes.  

By examining these factors, the project reveals correlations and insights that connect individual habits and collective trends to happiness levels. Visual analysis reveals interesting contrasts- like the relationship between commute length and happinessâ€” and identifies areas where personal and community metrics align or differ.  

This analysis is intended to inspire reflection on how our daily choices and habits shape our happiness, and demonstrate the power of visualizing data. The project's results provide a foundation for deeper conversations about what makes us happy.
